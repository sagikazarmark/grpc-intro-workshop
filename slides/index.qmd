# About RPC

## Definition ðŸ¤”

> [...] a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute **in a different address space**
> (commonly on _another computer on a shared network_), which is coded as if it were a **normal (local) procedure call**,
> **without** the programmer explicitly coding the **details for the remote interaction**
>
> _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call)_

## Definition

- **in a different address space** â†’ someone else's computer
- **normal (local) procedure call** â†’ interface
- **no details for the remote interaction** â†’ implementation

## Characteristics

- client-server architecture
- request-response protocol

## Interface Definition Language

- a language for describing communication
- programming language agnostic
- serves as a contract for RPC APIs

# RPC vs REST

---

|                       | **RPC**                          | **REST**                     |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| _Operates on_         | procedures<br>("function calls") | resources                    |
| _Underlying protocol_ | unspecified                      | primarily HTTP               |
| _Interactions_        | protocol encapsulated            | HTTP is part of the contract |

---

- RPC is more suitable for APIs describing _actions_ (vs _resources_)
- RPC has better type-safety guarantees
- RPC is more strict
- REST may be more performant when operating on large amount of data

## RPC example in HTTP

```http
POST /sayHello HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": 1
}
```

## REST example

```http
GET /users/1/greeting HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
```

# Introduction to gRPC

## About gRPC

- High performance
- Language agnostic ([supported languages](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/))
- Uses http/2 transport
- Bi-directional streaming
- Pluggable auth, tracing, load balancing and health checking

## IDL: Protocol Buffers

- Interface Definition Language
- Message format (binary serialization)
- Code generation framework

## Example 1: Protocol Buffers

# Implementing a gRPC service

## Example 2: Service definition and server implementation

## Example 3: Using the client stub

## RPC lifecycle

- _Unary RPC_
- Server streaming RPC
- Client streaming RPC
- Bidirectional streaming RPC

## Example 4: Server streaming RPC

# Advanced features

---

- [Authentication](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth/)
- Metadata
- [Error handling](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/error/)

## Example 5: Authentication and error handling

## Interceptors

- Act as middlewares during the request lifecycle
- Server vs Client
- Unary vs Stream

## Example 6: Server unary interceptor

# When to use gRPC?

---

> With great power comes great responsibility

---

- API operates on _actions_ instead of _resources_
- When efficient communication is a goal
- In polyglot environments
- No need for supporting a wide range of clients
- Internal APIs

_whisper_ microservices

## gRPC shortcomings

- Limited web/browser support
- Not human-readable format (more difficult to debug)
- Steeper learning curve

# Alternatives

## Twirp

Developed at Twitch as a lightweight alternative to gRPC.

## Connect

A gRPC-compatible framework with an emphasis on browser- and web-compatibility (from the creators of [Buf](https://buf.build/)).
